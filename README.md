â¦¿ OVERVIEW:-

 âž¤ This project implements an end-to-end deep learning pipeline for classifying images from the CIFAR10 dataset. The goal is to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model
    to accurately categorize images into one of 10 distinct classes: airplanes, automobiles, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, and trucks.

 âž¤ The project demonstrates key steps in a typical deep learning workflow, including data handling, model definition, training, evaluation, and model persistence. It serves as
    a practical application of CNNs for image recognition tasks using the PyTorch framework.
    
â¦¿ KEY FEATURES:-

 âž¤ Data Loading and Preprocessing: Efficient loading of the CIFAR10 dataset using `torchvision` and standard image transformations (ToTensor, Normalization).
 
 âž¤ Advanced CNN Architecture: Implementation of a custom CNN model (`AdvancedNet`) incorporating convolutional layers, batch normalization, ReLU activations, max pooling, and
    dropout for robust feature extraction and classification.
    
 âž¤ Model Training: A training loop using the Adam optimizer and Cross-Entropy Loss, with progress monitoring.
 
 âž¤ Model Evaluation: Comprehensive evaluation of the trained model on the test dataset to assess accuracy.
 
 âž¤ Prediction Demonstration: Code to showcase model inference on sample test images.
 
 âž¤ Model Saving: Functionality to save the trained model's state dictionary for future use.
